# frenly ðŸ‘€
frenly is a blockchain-powered social app that brings users together based on web3 data and offers a seamless way to engage with web3. With familiar features like twitter has, users can also take advantage of NFT purchases, governance voting, token-based communities and more.
## manifesto
We believe web3 identity and communication of on-chain actions will be essential in the future. In addition, we do believe the user experience will be much richer in SocialFi and its popularity will significantly grow in the next 5 years. At the same time, current social networks arenâ€™t designed for such on-chain communications and they cannot unleash all the hidden web3 capabilities.

We are committed to breaking down barriers to entry and adoption of web3, making it accessible, simple, and fun.
